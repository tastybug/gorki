- idea: right now I have to push gorki images manually to docker hub. I can utilize their automated build infra by building gorki inside Dockerfile
+ Dockerize gorki
+ Local web server for development
+ Makefile to make things easier
- CI (article: https://www.docker.com/blog/multi-arch-build-and-images-the-simple-way/)
- Document expected structure of a site, format of posts
- use yaml for articles
+ Generate a "Blog Post as HTML"
+ Generate a "Blog Posts Overview Page"
- Generate a "Blog Posts Archive Page" or some other form of pagination
- Generate a "Tags Page"
+ Generate RSS template
+ Introduce buckets for everything
+ draft flag in posts
+ chronologically ordered list of articles
+ use standard project layout (great intro with example code at https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2019/simple-go-project-layout-with-modules/)
